        <p class="text-4xl font-semibold text-start">Q1: Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</p>
        <p class="text-3xl font-semibold my-3">Ans:</p>
        <p class="text-lg font-normal"><span class="font-bold">1. var:</span> var is a functional scope variable. Also
            it is a changing & hoisting variable when you use this it is hoisted upper level of this called variable. It
            was used on past but now we using let as a changeable variable and it has not any kind of hoisting problem.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg font-normal"><span class="font-bold">2. let:</span> let is block scope variable. If you want
            to reassign any value you have
            to use "Let" because "let"
            is a changeable variable</p>
        <p class="text-lg font-normal"><span class="font-bold">3. const:</span> const is a block scope variable. If you
            have a permanent value which
            will be not changing this time
            you have to use "const"
            variable. But if you want to change assigned value which is belongs to an array or object you can easily
            change the value of element. Exm: const num = [1, 2, 3]; now you want to change the 2 with 6 you can -->
            num[1] = 5.</p>

        <p class="text-4xl font-semibold text-start">Q1: Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</p>
        <p class="text-3xl font-semibold my-3">Ans:</p>
        <p class="text-lg font-normal"><span class="font-bold">1. null:</span> null means an empty value or a blank
            value. It is one of primitive types in JS. The variable which has been assigned as null contains no value.
            If you check the typeOf() this
            assigned value you got the result of object </p>
        <p class="text-lg font-normal"><span class="font-bold">2. undefined:</span> undefined means the variable has
            been declared but no assigned right now. This is also primitive types in JS. If you declare a variable but
            not assigned any value then you got
            undefined. If you check the typeOf() undefined you got the result is undefined.</p>

        <p class="text-4xl font-semibold text-start">Q1: What do you mean by REST API?</p>
        <p class="text-3xl font-semibold my-3">Ans:</p>
        <p class="text-lg font-normal"><span class="font-bold">1. Rest API:</span> An API (application programming
            interface) also known as (RESTful API) is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can connect
            to and communicate with each other. REST stands for (representational state transfer) and was created by
            computer scientist (Roy Fielding).</p>
